## [Hungry Snake](https://codegym.cc/projects/games/com.codegym.games.snake)

### Rules:
- The player controls the movement of the snake, which slithers about a square field: up, down, right and left.
- The snake cannot stop moving.
- The objective of the game is to eat as many apples as possible. Apples appear in succession in a random place on the playing field as soon as the snake swallows the previous apple.
- With each new apple, the snake grows on one segment (occupies one more cell). 3. When our game starts, the snake is three cells long (has three segments) and can grow to 28 cells.
- As the snake grows, the game speed increases.
- The snake cannot pass through itself or leave the playing field.
- The game ends in victory if the snake grows to 28 segments long.
- The game ends in a loss if the snake runs into itself or the edge of the playing field.

### Future Tasks:
- Make the game easier or harder by changing the formula for accelerating turns.
- Change the scoring system so that it depends on the game speed.
- Give the snake the ability to pass through walls.
- Besides apples, generate other fruit that give bonuses (for example, protection against the next collision).
- If the player wins, proceed to higher levels.
